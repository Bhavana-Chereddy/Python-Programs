HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM
##################################

Note:
- You will need to install python 3.10 interpreter for this project to work.
- You will need to install "tabulate" package

Approach:
I have chosen to develop a Hotel Reservation System for my individual project in Python with connection to SQLite
database. The objective was to provide a clean and clear interface for a user to try and book their stay at a hotel.
The guest is asked if they want to select a hotel to book a room, leave a review for a hotel they stayed in 
or read the reviews that are already given by others.
This hotel reservation system has three hotel the user can choose from. The guest will be asked to enter the id 
of the hotel that they want to proceed with. Each hotel has different types of rooms and different costs that the 
user can choose from.
The next menu that is displayed after the user selects the hotel they would like to stay in further has 3 options 
to choose from, they can either proceed to select a room of their choice from the given list of rooms, they can read 
reviews of the hotel or they can leave a review for others to see. Let's look at these in more detail - 
1. Select a room to book - When the user chooses this option, a list of available rooms along with it's price,
description and amenities are displayed. The guest is then asked to enter their name, enter the preferred room type. 
The user is then showed a list of dates that the room is already booked for. The user is then asked to enter the checkin
and checkout date. If the room is available during those days then they can proceed with booking else they are asked 
to enter different dates. After this, the user is prompted with the total estimated price of the their stay. Our billing 
system is very simple and out price is inclusive of all taxes. Once the user confirms that they are okay with their booking
the details of their booking are displayed. The user then continue to book another room or exit. 
2. The second option that is given to users is read the reviews about the hotel. Before booking a hotel I have given the 
users an option to read the reviews that other customers have given.
3. The other option that I have given my users is to leave a review for the hotels that they have visited and experienced. 

Overall, I had a great time working on this project! I spent a lot of time on it, but I managed to clear all the errors 
which was the fun part!
